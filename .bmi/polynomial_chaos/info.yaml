summary: "The polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a general framework
  for the approximate representation of random response functions in
  terms of finite-dimensional series expansions in standardized random
  variables. An important distinguishing feature of the methodology is
  that the functional relationship between random inputs and outputs
  is captured, not merely the output statistics as in the case of many
  nondeterministic methodologies."
