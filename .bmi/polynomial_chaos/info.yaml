summary: "The polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a general framework
for the approximate representation of random response functions in
terms of finite-dimensional series expansions in standardized random
variables. An important distinguishing feature of the methodology is
that the functional relationship between random inputs and outputs is
captured, not merely the output statistics as in the case of many
nondeterministic methodologies."
