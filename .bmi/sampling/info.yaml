summary: "Dakota's sampling method generates parameter values by
  drawing samples from the specified uncertain variable probability
  distributions. The computational model is executed over all
  generated parameter values to compute the responses for which
  statistics are computed. The statistics support sensitivity analysis
  and uncertainty quantification."
