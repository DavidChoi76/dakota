summary: "Dakota's sampling method generates parameter values by
drawing samples from the specified uncertain variable probability
distributions. The computational model is executed over all generated
parameter values to compute the responses for which statistics are
computed. The statistics support sensitivity analysis and uncertainty
quantification."
