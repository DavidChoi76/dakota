summary: "Dakota's centered parameter study computes response data
  sets along multiple coordinate-based vectors, one per parameter,
  centered about the initial values from the variables'
  specification. This is useful for investigation of function contours
  with respect to each parameter individually in the vicinity of a
  specific point (e.g., post-optimality analysis for verification of a
  minimum), thereby avoiding the cost associated with a
  multidimensional grid."
