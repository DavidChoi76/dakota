summary: "Dakota's centered parameter study computes response data
sets along multiple coordinate-based vectors, one per parameter,
centered about the initial values from the variables
specification. This is useful for investigation of function contours
with respect to each parameter individually in the vicinity of a
specific point (e.g., post-optimality analysis for verification of a
minimum), thereby avoiding the cost associated with a multidimensional
grid."
