summary: "Stochastic collocation is a general framework for
  approximate representation of random response functions in terms of
  finite-dimensional interpolation bases.  The stochastic collocation
  (SC) method is very similar to polynomial chaos (PCE), with the key
  difference that the orthogonal polynomial basis functions are
  replaced with interpolation polynomial bases. The interpolation
  polynomials may be either local or global and either value-based or
  gradient-enhanced. In the local case, valued-based are piecewise
  linear splines and gradient-enhanced are piecewise cubic splines,
  and in the global case, valued-based are Lagrange interpolants and
  gradient-enhanced are Hermite interpolants. Thus, in PCE, one forms
  coefficients for known orthogonal polynomial basis functions,
  whereas SC forms multidimensional interpolation functions for known
  coefficients."
