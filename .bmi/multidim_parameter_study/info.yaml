summary: "Dakota's multidimensional parameter study computes response
  data sets for an n-dimensional grid of points. Each continuous and
  discrete range variable is partitioned into equally spaced intervals
  between its upper and lower bounds, each discrete set variable is
  partitioned into equally spaced index intervals. The partition
  boundaries in n-dimensional space define a grid of points, and every
  point is evaluated."
