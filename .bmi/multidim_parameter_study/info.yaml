summary: "Dakota's multidimensional parameter study computes response
data sets for an n-dimensional grid of points. Each continuous and
discrete range variable is partitioned into equally spaced intervals
between its upper and lower bounds, each discrete set variable is
partitioned into equally spaced index intervals. The partition
boundaries in n-dimensional space define a grid of points, and every
point is evaluated."
