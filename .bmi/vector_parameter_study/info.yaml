summary: "Dakota's vector parameter study computes response data sets
  at selected intervals along a vector in parameter space. It is often
  used for single-coordinate parameter studies (to study the effect of
  a single variable on a response set), but it can be used more
  generally for multiple coordinate vector studies (to investigate the
  response variations along some n-dimensional vector such as an
  optimizer search direction)."
