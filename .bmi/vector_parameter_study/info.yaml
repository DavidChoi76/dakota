summary: "Dakota's vector parameter study computes response data sets
at selected intervals along a vector in parameter space. It is often
used for single-coordinate parameter studies (to study the effect of a
single variable on a response set), but it can be used more generally
for multiple coordinate vector studies (to investigate the response
variations along some n-dimensional vector such as an optimizer search
direction)."
